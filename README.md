# Sustainable Tourism Project

## Overview

This project focuses on sustainable tourism in Barcelona, visualizing tourist density, noise levels, and points of interest. The application consists of three main components: backend, frontend, and data processing. This is the frontend part.

## Development server

Make sure you have Angular CLI installed.

To install Angular CLI globally, run:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

If you installed Angular CLI, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 
If you don't have Angular CLI installed, you can run `npm run start` to start the development server.
